Bayes Test
===================
Don't get excited nothing to see here really.

Bayes Test application in NodeJS for representation of academic confidence

[Live Here](http://bayes.herokuapp.com/)

Development
========================================
TODOS

    Actual confidence rating part
    Move profiles over to REST API
    Sign Up
    Finish Edit User Data
    Validation for the above
    A LOT OF OTHER STUFF


Extent of implementation is limited to sessions, log in and out, profiles. Though most of this is very limited.

It's documented as best as I could at this early hour.

Need the full data dictionary / schema to actually progress with the application's primary purpose. I suspect Gary may provide that soon? Until then I'll continue to improve on this, no doubt.

Until then. Enjoy.
